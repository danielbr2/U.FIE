# Using Python for Introductory Econometrics - Code Repository

Welcome to the **Using Python for Introductory Econometrics** GitHub repository! This repository contains all the Python code examples and scripts that accompany the book *Using Python for Introductory Econometrics*. 

The book introduces Python as a tool for implementing key econometric methods covered in Jeffrey M. Wooldridge’s textbook *Introductory Econometrics*. The code here is structured to mirror the chapters of Wooldridge’s book and offers practical implementations of the econometric models and concepts using Python.

## Content and Approach

The book and repository are designed for students and practitioners familiar with the theory of econometrics, primarily through Wooldridge's textbook. This resource provides a hands-on guide for transitioning from theory to practice, with the following key topics covered:

- **Intro to Python** for econometrics
- **Simple and multiple regression** using matrix form and black box routines
- **Inference** in small samples and asymptotics
- **Monte Carlo simulations**
- **Heteroscedasticity**
- **Time series regression**
- **Pooled cross-sections and panel data**
- **Instrumental variables (IV) and two-stage least squares (2SLS)**
- **Simultaneous equation models**
- **Limited dependent variables**: binary, count data, censored/truncated samples, and selection models
- **Formatted reports** with Jupyter Notebooks, combining Python code with Markdown or LaTeX

## Structure

Each chapter in this repository corresponds to a chapter from Wooldridge's *Introductory Econometrics*. The code demonstrates how to:

1. **Implement econometric methods** with Python, replicating textbook examples.
2. **Understand built-in Python functions** for estimation and inference by directly applying the mathematical formulas.
3. **Run supplementary analyses**, including Monte Carlo simulations to deepen intuition.
 
## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository** or download the scripts by chapter.
2. Open the relevant Python code files in a Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE.
3. Follow along with the code, modify it, and run the examples to replicate econometric methods.
