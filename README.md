# Using Python, R, and Julia for Introductory Econometrics - Code Repository

Welcome to the **Using Python, R, and Julia for Introductory Econometrics** GitHub repository! This repository contains all the code examples and scripts from the series of books titled *Using Python for Introductory Econometrics*, *Using R for Introductory Econometrics*, and *Using Julia for Introductory Econometrics*. These books introduce three popular programming languages for implementing econometric methods based on Jeffrey M. Wooldridge’s textbook *Introductory Econometrics*.

The code is organized by chapter and provides practical implementations of econometric models and techniques using **Python**, **R**, and **Julia**.

## Content and Approach

These books are designed for students and practitioners already familiar with econometric theory, particularly through Wooldridge's *Introductory Econometrics*. They provide a hands-on guide for applying econometric concepts using the following programming languages:
- **Python**
- **R**
- **Julia**

The repository contains code for key topics, including:

- **Introduction to Python, R, and Julia** for econometrics
- **Simple and multiple regression** using matrix form and built-in functions
- **Inference** in small samples and asymptotics
- **Monte Carlo simulations**
- **Heteroscedasticity**
- **Time series regression**
- **Pooled cross-sections and panel data**
- **Instrumental variables (IV) and two-stage least squares (2SLS)**
- **Simultaneous equation models**
- **Limited dependent variables**: binary, count data, censoring, truncation, and sample selection
- **Formatted reports** using Jupyter Notebooks, Markdown, or LaTeX

The books follow the same chapter structure as Wooldridge’s textbook, ensuring a smooth transition from theory to practical implementation across all three languages.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository** or download the scripts by chapter.
2. Open the relevant code files in your preferred environment (Jupyter Notebook for Python, RStudio for R, or any Julia IDE).
3. Follow along with the code, modify, and run the examples to implement econometric methods in any of the three languages.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions! Whether you want to improve the code, suggest additional analyses, or report any issues, feel free to submit a pull request. Since these books are self-published and continuously updated, your feedback and contributions are valuable to keep this resource growing.

## License

This repository is open-source and free for educational use across all three languages.
